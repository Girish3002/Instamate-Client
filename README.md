# Instamate

## Description

Instamate is a social media platform that I have created as a personal project. It is an Instagram clone that aims to replicate many of the popular features found on the original platform. The platform allows users to create profiles, upload photos and videos, follow other users, and interact with posts through likes and comments.

Users can also explore content on the platform through a search feature and a feed of popular posts. The platform is designed to be user-friendly and visually appealing, with a modern and minimalist interface.

In creating Instamate, my goal was to develop my skills in web development and gain experience working with popular frameworks such as React and Node.js. I also wanted to create a project that would be both fun and challenging, while also allowing me to showcase my abilities to potential employers or clients.

Overall, Instamate is a passion project that I am proud to have developed and I hope that users will find it to be a fun and engaging social media platform.
